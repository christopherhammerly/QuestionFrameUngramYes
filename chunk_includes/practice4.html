How do you know whether a sentence fragment is ungrammatical?  If the sentence contains a clear error that you don't think an English speaker would make, that is ungrammatical. An example of an ungrammatical sentence fragment in English is "this one girl are...", because for most speakers "are" can't be used with "this one girl". Grammatical sentences sound like natural English you might imagine a friend or colleague starting a sentence that way. For example, "this one girl is..." is a sentence that many speakers find grammatical.

We are not interested in whether an English professor would think the sentence is bad. We are more interested in how native English speakers speak in day-to-day conversation.
