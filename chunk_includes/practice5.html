<p>

You'll find that you have a strong, natural intuition about whether a sentence sounds bad, and we just want you to report that 'gut feeling' without overthinking it.

There are no right or wrong answers; many speakers have different intuitions about whether a sentence sounds ungrammatical, and that's perfectly natural. Just pay close attention throughout the experiment, and use your gut instincts.
